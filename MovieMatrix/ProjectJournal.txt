    - looked at TMDB (created an API account w/key)
    - looked at Postman - 
        ran a sample API call this gave JSON data
    - looked at website json2csharp.com that displayed
      the classes that data would need! *copied the 
      JSON data from Postman and converted it to classes

    - created our project application
    - removed extra fluff
    - created our Fetch.cs (will be used for API calls)
    - added a search textbox
    - sent that string to a method, that called our 
      fetch.Search()
    - saw the RAW JSON data in string form returned 👍



// Friday Aug 20th

    - take the raw JSON parse it (magic!)
    - populate our classes to hold that data
    - read through the data and display the details
    - a bit of CSS to have the posters look nice!
    - added an asp-page-handler for Details(movieID)
    - added a GetDetails() method in the Fetch.cs
    - added a collection to Postman and then 
      added a 'new request' and set up our movieSearch
      request sample
    - did not get a new 🪑

    - created out GetDetails API call in Postman
    - ran the API in Postman

      rep what we wanted to display
